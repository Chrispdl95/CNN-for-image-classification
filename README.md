# CNN-for-image-classification

In this repository i have implemented a Convolutional neural network to classify
images into 10 categories. CIFAR-10 dataset has been used as a benchmark
to train the network. The model overfitting is reduced by using regularization
and dropout methods.The complex neural network performed better with 76
% accuracy on the test data.
